	<h1>MyDemo RightThere is here!</h1>
		<h2>It's finally here!</h2>
		<p>
		Today we've announced a great new solution for all those
		looking to make unified communications a reality. We are all struggling with
		the proliferation of more or less improvised communications infrastructures:
		with bring your own device, many teams have vastly different toolsets for mail,
		voice, IM chat, etc.
		IT has often given up trying to regulate this mess, but is rather looking for
		solutions which can make all these tools work together.
		</p>
		<h2>RightThere: the right solution</h2>
		<p>
		Now MyDemo RightThere is here to provide exactly that! With
		our RealLife Platform, we can provide connectivity can provide connectivity
		between any older N7 RightThere System rooms can collaborate with new Lync
		clients in Virtual Meeting Rooms. You can install an the HDX Eye Detector and
		other cool immersive technologies right in your N7 environments. You can even use
		your traditional NUCM and N7 video assets.
		</p>
		<p>
		Not only does this work out-of-the-box, but its also smart. Reducing bandwidth
		and eliminating the need for expensive gateways to tie everything together.
		</p>
		<p>
		Even better, it's all based on the RightThere Interoperability Protocol which
		is open and available to any vendor signed up to IMTC. As Eileen Li, our CMO,
		said at our recent briefing on the release: "Enterprises need to ensure they use
		open and interoperable protocols to ensure that they get the functionality they
		need while protecting existing investments. A multivendor approach can reduce
		costs and simplify network complexity"
